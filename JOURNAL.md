# July 28th: Pcb schematics!

I started a new project in EasyEDA! Browsed components and placed them in the schematic. Wired everything up and now the schematics should be done! When following the instructions I didn't know they used EasyEDA STD and I was using EasyEDA PRO. so I got very confused and I couldn't find the antenna, so I switched over to EasyEDA STD. I will now make start designing the pcb.

# July 28th: Pcb making!

I worked on making the actual PCB card and wiring the components together! I spent a lot of time trying to use auto route but there were some connections it couldn't make so I had to manually route them. I plan to personalize the PCB card now!!
